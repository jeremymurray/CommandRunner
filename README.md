CommandRunner
=============

A C# wrapper that allows regex inspection and modification of subcommand output.

Run 'cr --help' for usage and options.

Builds under Mono and VS2010.  See build-mono.bat and build-vs.bat.
For either, edit the bat file to point gmcs or csc to your local installation of those files.
If gmcs is a bat file, don't forget to prefix it with "call", like the example.
